Our Standards Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community Examples of unacceptable behavior include: The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Enforcement Responsibilities Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. Scope This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Enforcement Guidelines Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct: 1. Correction Community Impact : Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Consequence : A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested. 2. Warning Community Impact : A violation through a single incident or series of actions. Consequence : A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. 3. Temporary Ban Community Impact : A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. Consequence : A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.

Technology is changing quickly. With high-powered IoT chips now under $6, every device in your home, on a farm and even in your beehive can be continually monitored for health. We think this is a fantastic opportunity to learn and share ideas with other IoT enthusiasts and to keep companies in our areas internationally competitive. What is the best way to learn about IoT? Join this event and learn about IoT from the experts. We will be providing a variety of resources to help you get started. Do I need to be a student to participate? No. The event is open to all participants: entrepreneurs, students, mentors, teachers and professionals. How much does it cost to participate? Our event is free to attend. Do I need to be an experience programmer to participate? No! There are roles for people doing documentation, testing, getting the presentation ready, doing research on competing products, calculating part costs and profit margins, writing the elevator pitch, designing logos and color patterns for the devices we create. Everyone is welcome to participate. Do real-world IoT devices get created after these events? Yes. We have had several projects \"graduate\" from the event to become commercial products. Can I just drop off my kids? No. Parents must be present at the events. What is the minimum age requirement to participate? There is no age minimum requirement. However, all children must be accompanied by a parent. Can I learn how to solder? Yes! In the past, we have had several people who have been able to learn to solder at these events. When you check in, please let one of the volunteers know you would like to learn how to solder and you will be matched with someone to help you. What are examples of devices that beginning students have built in the past? The most common examples are devices that use sensors and change a display. For example you can have buttons that change the patterns of colors on an LED strip. Other examples are devices that sense temperature noise and send notifications to a phone via a test message. One of the best ways to get started is to turn your microcontroller into a mini-web server that you can then use to control lights or motors. How many people can I have in my team? We suggest teams of 2-5 people. We have had individuals in the past, but we strongly believe in Social constructionism and that people learn the most when they are working on teams. What if I don't have a team? We will work with you to find a team that matches your interest and needs. I already have a great idea, but I am not an experienced developer. Can I lead a team doing this project? Yes! You should create a short writeup of your idea and we will circulate this idea to other people looking to join a team. The will then contact you to be on your team. How to you create teams? We try to get a mix of seniority and skills on each team. Much of the work finding a team is done informally by the participants. I am a female and I would like to be on an all female team? Can you arrange that? Yes. We can work to find you other team members that will fullfil these requirements. The earlier you register and let us know your goals the higher the chance we can get you on the right team. Whe do teams usually form? Most teams are formed a week or two before the actual event. So for example if our event in on October 22nd, we will form teams around October 15th. Teams that have specific interests and needs should try to form before this date. Do you have a Slack or Discord channel? We are working on this no (August 2022) and we will let all participants know when we have one setup. Please register ASAP to get notified when we have one.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#iot-hackday-faq","text":"","title":"IoT Hackday FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#why-is-iot-hackday-so-important","text":"Technology is changing quickly.

Your are all set. However, if you are a first-timer to these events, you might want some suggestions of ideas. You can do one of these projects using our sample code and devices or you can mix and match these ideas to create a new project that is unique to your team. Here are just a few ideas for teams that you can get started with classified by difficulty level. Beginning Teams - Low difficulty Control an LED strip with MicroPython (just 12 lines of Python code) Control the flashing of an LED with a web server Control an LED pattern with a web page Control the message on a LED matrix with a web page Intermediate Teams - Medium difficulty Get the weather forecast from a web service and display it on OLED matrix Get notifications from a service such as IFTTT and display them on an OLED matrix Find some of the new sensors and integrated them into a device Turn servos on or off using relays of high current switches (requires parental supervision) Advanced Teams - High difficulty Combine moisture sensors, weather and rainfall data to control sprinklers Use a library such as TinyML to perform complex pattern recognition on incomming signals Combine knowledge graphs and reasoning on sensor data to make good decisions about what events are relevant Use machine learning an anomaly detection system to detect unusual events such as when a machine needs servicing or is out of allegement Use a camera and the Python OpenCV library to detect motion and take photos of interesting events. Requires a Raspberry Pi camera module or a NVIDIA Jetson Nano camera module (see event organizers for details).","title":"Team Ideas"},{"location":"team-ideas/#team-ideas","text":"Do you have an idea for a new IoT product?
