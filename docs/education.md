# Education at the IoT Hackday

![](gallery/alona-mccreary.png)

Every year we ask ourself *How can we increase the quality of our education at this years IoT Hackday?*

In the past we have done the following:

* Provided experience mentors on as many teams as we could
* Provide sample IoT kits to get started
* Invited teachers from local schools to participate in the hackathon

## Focus for 2022

* This year we are putting a special focus on getting more women and minorities involved in our educational programs.  We are specifically working with organizations such as [Code Savvy](http://codesavvy.org) to increase participation of women and students from disadvantaged communities.  Please contact [Val Lockart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valockhart/) or send email to [val@codesavvy.org](mailto:val@codesavvy.org.) if you have questions or can help us find other ways to engage with our underrepresented communities.

## Costumes

Every year we try to make coding and IoT technology fun and appeal to students that focus on creativity and the arts.  We find that adding low-cost LEDs to costumes is a great way to make the experience more fun.

In 2019 the "Blue Ringed Octopus" costume was one of our favorites.
