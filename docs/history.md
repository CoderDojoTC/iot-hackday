# IOT Hackday History

This event started around 2014 by [Justin Grammens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justingrammens/) a group of people involved in the Arduino MN user group.  [Dan McCreary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmccreary) also spearheaded the educational portion of the event and purchased IoT kits for teachers and students.

The focus of the event has always been learning and sharing knowledge, and building community.  Although we do have "prizes", we put a low focus on ranking of winners and stress that there are no losers when we share knowledge.

Although we didn't schedule events during the COVID-19 pandemic, we did have some activities continue as on-line virtual events.
