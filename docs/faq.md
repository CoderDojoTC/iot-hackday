# IoT Hackday FAQ

## Why is IoT Hackday so important?

Technology is changing quickly.  With high-powered IoT chips now under $6, every device in your home, on a farm and even in your beehive can be continually monitored for health.  We think this is a fantastic opportunity to learn and share ideas with other IoT enthusiasts and to keep companies in our areas internationally competitive.

## What is the best way to learn about IoT?

Join this event and learn about IoT from the experts.  We will be providing a variety of resources to help you get started.

No.  The event is open to all participants: entrepreneurs, students, mentors, teachers and professionals.

## How much does it cost to participate?

Our event is free to attend.

## Do I need to be an experience programmer to participate?

No!  There are roles for people doing documentation, testing, getting the presentation ready, doing research on competing products, calculating part costs and profit margins, writing the elevator pitch,  designing logos and color patterns for the devices we create.  Everyone is welcome to participate.

## What are examples of devices that beginning students have built in the past?

The most common examples are devices that use sensors and change a display.  For example you can have buttons that change the patterns of colors on an LED strip.

Other examples are devices that sense temperature noise and send notifications to a phone via a test message.

One of the best ways to get started is to turn your microcontroller into a mini-web server that you can then use to control lights or motors.

## How many people can I have in my team?

We suggest teams of 2-5 people.  We have had individuals in the past, but we strongly believe in [Social constructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism#Educational_psychology) and that people learn the most when they are working on teams.

## What if I don't have a team?

We will work with you to find a team that matches your interest and needs.

## I already have a great idea, but I am not an experienced developer.  Can I lead a team doing this project?

Yes!  You should create a short writeup of your idea and we will circulate this idea to other people looking to join a team.  The will then contact you to be on your team.

## How to you create teams?

We try to get a mix of seniority and skills on each team.  Much of the work finding a team is done informally by the participants.

## I am a female and I would like to be on an all female team?  Can you arrange that?

Yes.  We can work to find you other team members that will fullfil these requirements.  The earlier you register and let us know your goals the higher the chance we can get you on the right team.

## Whe do teams usually form?

Most teams are formed a week or two before the actual event.  So for example if our event in on October 22nd, we will form teams around October 15th.  Teams that have specific interests and needs should try to form before this date.

## Do you have a Slack or Discord channel?

We are working on this no (August 2022) and we will let all participants know when we have one setup.  Please register ASAP to get notified when we have one.
